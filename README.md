# 📝 React To-Do App

This is a simple yet efficient to-do app built with React.js that helps you manage your daily tasks. All tasks are stored locally in your browser, so they’re available even after you close the app. 

## ✨ Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new to-do items.
- **Mark as Complete**: Track tasks by marking them as complete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks when they're no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses local storage to save tasks across sessions.
